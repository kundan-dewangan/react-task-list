# Reactjs Coding assignment

A page will contain a “list of tasks” and a “create task” button. Create Task widget will have title, Time left to finish the task (default time is 2 minutes), “Create” button, Cross (x) button to close the task. As soon as a new widget is open timer will start decreasing till the timer reaches zero. After the timer reaches zero, if we click on “Create” the widget will be added to the list with red colour and the widget will be closed. If we click on “Create” the widget before the timer reaches zero, the widget will be added to the list with green colour and the widget will be closed. On clicking the “Cross” (X) button, the widget will disappear with save and the widget will not be added to the list.
